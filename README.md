# Goats on a Phone #

There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Make your own iPhone wallpaper and get it texted to your phone. ##
  > Use this site to build a wallpaper out of some fun provided images - mostly goats. See what other people have made, and text their design or yours to your phone to use as your wallpaper.

## For when you're sick of nature backgrounds ##
  > This is for when you're tired of looking at high-definition grass blades or pictures of your kids, and want something that will make people ask "where'd you get that awesome goat background?"

## Summary ##
  > This browser application allows you to make an image the size of your phone, and then text it to yourself so that you can use it as your background.

## Problem ##
  > To make a background on your phone, you need to know roughly where the homescreen features are, and then you need at least MS paint or some kind of image manipulator to position what you want on your phone. It involves the combination of a few things that might not be available to users who don't have any design software. Then you need to upload it or email it to yourself to get it on your phone, which can be annoying. 

## Solution ##
  > This program makes background-making available to the layperson - all you need is a browser.

## Quote from the designer ##
  > "I want to make a background of a bunch of baby goats and I need a convenient way to do so." - Jammie Mountz, designer, visionary, and head engineer of 

## How to Get Started ##
  > Navigate to the self hosted page (or if I get it deployed, go there) and click the goats you want on your phone. Drag them around to the desired location and then enter your phone number to text a link of the picture to yourself.

## Customer Quote ##
  > "I originally had pictures of my grandkids on my phone. Now I have goats." - theoretical person who used this program.

## What are you waiting for? ##
  > Your phone has no goats and could have goats.
